Our App component renders our SearchBar component with a prop of onTermChange, 
passing in its own handleTermChange method as an argument
Our SearchBar calls its constructor() method upon initialization. 
It creates a new state object and sets the term propery to an empty string.
The user enters some text in the input field
Every time the user enters/deletes a character, 
React calls the onChange method on the input, 
automatically passing in an event object as an argument. 
Within its callback, we call our SearchBar class's onInputChange class method, 
passing through the event object.
The SearchBar's onInputChange method calls this.setState to update the 
state's term property. It also calls the App component's handleTermChange method, 
which is passed through the onTermChange prop.
Our App logs the search term to the console via the handleTermChange method
