## Fun React Giphy generator

Practice using React/Node /Bootstrap/Firebase

- npx create-react-app

- npm i --save superagent

- npm i --save react-modal

- npm i --save redux-promise

Redux-promise, a library that allows you to add a middle ware function to the store, and if it receives a promise as a paylod from an action, it will dispatch the resolved value of that promise.


SuperAgent is a small progressive client-side and Node.js HTTP request library, sporting many high-level HTTP client features.
